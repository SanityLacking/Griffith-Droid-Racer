This folder contains the code related to serial communication between the Onboard processor and the Arduino.

Folder Ardunio Code features the code to be run on the arduino directly connected to the motor controllers.

Folder Droid Side contains the  code for connecting to the Arduino via a serial port. This had been previously attempted with a usb to serial port on the Ardunio.

ToDO:
Droid Side code is not functional yet to talk to the Ardunio. A new solution needs to be found.
