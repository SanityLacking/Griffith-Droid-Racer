This code is taken directly from the car. This is the code that was running prevously on the car and includes the zed camera code to work with the previous camera set up.

This code represents the state of the project at the end of 2016. features code from the 2016 race, and updates implemented for open day 2016.

Functional with the zed camera, but unreliable detection.
