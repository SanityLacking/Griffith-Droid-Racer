Droid Code v4 is the 2018 implementation of the Droid Code.

The plan for this implementation is to have the droid controls consolidated, allowing all additional work to interact in the same way.

Please ensure all neccessary files that make the droid run are kept seperate from any other developmental files.

Matt is a bad name.
